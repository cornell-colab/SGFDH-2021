# Geographic Data & Spatial Visualization

### Before the Session  

**Sign up for an account** on [Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de).

**Sign up for an account** on [Cornell's Carto instance](https://cornell.carto.com/signup).  

**Login** to [Umap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/), by connecting your GitHub account to it. (When you hit the dialogue box that says "Choose Your Provider," hit the cat logo.)  

**Download** the datasets 2011_MilwaukeeCounty_Dog_Licenses_GEOCODED and DogsSubsetB from the [W4 page](https://github.com/cornell-colab/SGFDH-2021/tree/main/W4.%20Geospatial%20Data). As yesterday, click on the link each dataset. A page will open, and you'll see a preview of the data table.  
Toward the upper-right, you'll see a button that says "Raw." RIGHT-click it and choose "Save Link As."  
Choose a place on your machine to store it, and download it. **Make sure to save each file as a .csv, not as .txt.**

**Gather** from your computer one or two images that you associate with some geographic location, and **upload** each of them to your own [Cornell Box](https://cornell.box.com) account. (The image(s) can be of anything. They can be your own photos or images that you have downloaded from elsewhere.)

### During the Session  

#### Big Concepts  

* Visualization is a means of research. ([Richard White](https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/media/images/publication/what%20is%20spatial%20history%20pub%20020110.pdf))  
  
* Geospatial data = table + geometry + geospatial location  
  
* Geospatial geometry types: point, line, polygon

#### Umap Examples

* [Virtual Cartographies: Visualizing Mass Grave Recovery in Contemporary Spain](http://virtualcartographies.com/index.html)  
Wendy Perla Kurtz (UCLA Spanish and Portuguese)  

#### Carto Examples    
  
* [Global Poetics](https://globalpoetics.org/)  
Ama Bemma Adwetewa-Badu (Cornell Literatures in English)  

* [Chapakhana: Mapping the Spread of Print in South Asia](https://chapakhana.rcc.uchicago.edu/about/)  
Ulrike Stark & Team  

#### How to hotlink a multimedia file in Box (aka Using Box as an Image Host)

1. Open the file in Box, and click "Share."
2. In the dialogue box that appears, make sure that "People with the link" "Can share and download."
3. Click "Link Settings."
4. At the bottom of the new dialogue box, you will see a "Direct Link." This URL will end with .jpg, .png, or another image extension. Click "Copy."

### After the Session  

Continue playing with either Carto, Umap, or both. When you have a question about how to do something, try to figure it out from the documentation, then ask a question on the class message boards. **Bring a map to some stage of completion** (or just work on it til you run out of time!), and **share a link to it in your Daily Comment post, along with a note about any victories (things you figured out) or challenges (things you're still trying to figure out) you encountered.** Your map can depict anything! Here are a couple of examples, if you're stumped:  
* A map of all the Cocker Spaniels *and* all the Pit Bulls in Milwaukee County (2011)  
* A map of the last 5 photos in your photo roll and where they were taken, with whatever metadata you choose.
* A map of a few pieces of data from your summer project.
* Try swapping data sets and mapping platforms. That is, see if you can figure out how to make a photo map in Carto by drawing the points directly in the map, and then adding a photo to the pop-up window. Or, try uploading the dog data to uMap, and see what you can make. (Use the DogSubsetB csv, which is just a few hundred data points instead of 10s of 1000s.) Poking around and trying stuff is the #1 A+ way to learn the capabilities and limits of a given platform.  
* Check out this [map of historical photos in two small towns on the France-Germany border](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/hanskarte_302394#14/49.4453/6.8613). Note the different templates for popups. Some are pop-up bubbles, some are side panels, and the template itself varies from layer to layer and item to item. See if you can figure out how to create varying kinds of popups/information panels in uMap.  
* Any other type of map you can come up with!
  
### Reference Material  

#### Umap Documentation  

The Umap documentation is a little spotty, especially in English. Here are some pages I found helpful:  

* [Umap Guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap/Guide). Note the links to versions of the guide in some other langugaes, some of which are more extensive than the English version, and may be useful.
* [A Few FAQs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap/FAQ)
* [How to format text in popups](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap/Guide/Text_formatting)  
* [How to share a map or download data](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap/Guide/Export_data_of_my_uMap)
* [Creating a slideshow](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap/Guide/Setup_slideshow). Unfortunately, the English version of this page is just a stub; [this Dutch version](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap/Guide/Setup_slideshow) is more complete, and includes lots of screenshots, which could possibly be useful even if you can't make sense of the Dutch.  
  
#### Carto Documentation  

* [Tutorials for Carto Builder](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/using-builder/)
* [Documentation for the Carto Dashboard](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/your-dashboard-overview/)
