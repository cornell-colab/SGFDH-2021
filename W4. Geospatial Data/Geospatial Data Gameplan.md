# Geographic Data & Spatial Visualization

### Before the Session  

**Sign up for an account** on [Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de).

**Sign up for an account** on [Cornell's Carto instance](https://cornell.carto.com/signup).  

**Login** to [Umap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/), by connecting your GitHub account to it. (When you hit the dialogue box that says "Choose Your Provider," hit the cat logo.)  

**Download** the datasets 2011_MilwaukeeCounty_Dog_Licenses_GEOCODED and DogsSubsetB from the [W4 page](https://github.com/cornell-colab/SGFDH-2021/tree/main/W4.%20Geospatial%20Data). As yesterday, click on the link each dataset. A page will open, and you'll see a preview of the data table.  
Toward the upper-right, you'll see a button that says "Raw." RIGHT-click it and choose "Save Link As."  
Choose a place on your machine to store it, and download it. **Make sure to save each file as a .csv, not as .txt.**

**Gather** from your computer one or two images that you associate with some geographic location, and **upload** each of them to your own [Cornell Box](https://cornell.box.com) account. (The image(s) can be of anything. They can be your own photos or images that you have downloaded from elsewhere.)

### After the Session  

Continue playing with either Carto, Umap, or both. When you have a question about how to do something, try to figure it out from the documentation, then ask a question on the class message boards. **Bring a map to some stage of completion, and share a link to it in your Daily Comment post, along with a note about any victories (things you figured out) or challenges (things you're still trying to figure out) you encountered.** Your map can depict anything! Here are a couple of examples, if you're stumped:  
* A map of all the Cocker Spaniels *and* all the Pit Bulls in Milwaukee County (2011)  
* A map of the last 5 photos in your photo roll and where they were taken, with whatever metadata you choose.
* A map of a few pieces of data from your summer project.
