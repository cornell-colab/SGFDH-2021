* **Sign up for an account** on [Cornell's Carto instance](https://cornell.carto.com/signup).  

* **Login** to [Umap](http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/), by connecting your GitHub account to it. (When you hit the dialogue box that says "Choose Your Provider," hit the cat logo.)  

* **Download** the datasets MilwaukeeDogsGeocoded and DogsSubsetB from the W4 page. Rename as csv yesterday.  

* **Gather** from your computer one or two images that you associate with some geographic location, and **upload** each of them to your own [Cornell Box](https://cornell.box.com) account. (The images can be of anything. They can be your own photos or images that you have downloaded from elsewhere.)
