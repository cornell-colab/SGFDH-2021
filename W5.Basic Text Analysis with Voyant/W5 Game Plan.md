### Prepare for the Session 

1. Please bring a sample of text to the session. 
 * It can be in any language (the more the merrier!) 
 * It should be in one of these formats: plain text, HTML, XML, PDF, RTF, or MS Word (beware that the PDF format should have underlying text - a picture-only version will not suffice.  If you are unsure, try searching on a word in the PDF - if you can't find a term through teh search function, the document likely has no underlying textflow.) 
 * The text will be uploaded to a cloud-based tool, so it should not contain anything you determine is sensitive information.  The privacy policy can be found in full here: https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/about-section-privacy-statement 

2. Come to the session prepared to share your screen. 

### After the Session

#### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* Can you imagine using methods of distant reading in your project? If so, what methods?
* Are there uses outside of your project where text analysis might be useful?
