### Prepare for the Session 

1. Please bring a sample of text to the session. 
  * It can be in any language (the more the merrier!) Try to pick something moderatley long (100+ pages) 
  * It should be in one of these formats: plain text, HTML, XML, PDF, RTF, or MS Word (beware that the PDF format should have underlying text - a picture-only version will not suffice.  If you are unsure, try searching on a word in the PDF - if you can't find a term through teh search function, the document likely has no underlying textflow.) 
  * The text will be uploaded to a cloud-based tool, so it should not contain anything you determine is sensitive information.  The privacy policy can be found in full here: https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/about-section-privacy-statement 

2. Come to the session prepared to share your screen. 

### During the Session
1. We will do a group exercise with a toolset called Voyant.  
  * Voyant can be found at https://voyant-tools.org/
  * The documentation is exceedingly good! See the full manual - https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/start

2. In breakouts, you will practice using the tool with the texts you brought. You'll explore the tools and determine where the tools excel and where they seem to break down. 
  * Agree upon a list of at least three things you liked most about this tool (can be more).
  * Agree upon a list three things you wish it did that it doesn't do, or three things that it could do better. Assist each other in understanding the full potential of the tool. 
  * What sorts of purposes could you envision using this tool for?  

### After the Session

#### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* Can you imagine using methods of distant reading in your project? If so, what methods?
* Are there uses outside of your project where text analysis might be useful?
