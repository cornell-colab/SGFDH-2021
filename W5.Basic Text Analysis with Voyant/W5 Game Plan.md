### Prepare for the Session 

#### 1. Please bring a sample of text to the session. 
  * It can be in any language (the more the merrier!) Try to pick something moderatley long (100+ pages) 
  * It should be in one of these formats: plain text, HTML, XML, PDF, RTF, or MS Word (beware that the PDF format should have underlying text - a picture-only version will not suffice.  If you are unsure, try searching on a word in the PDF - if you can't find a term through the search function, the document likely has no underlying textflow.) 
  * The text will be uploaded to a cloud-based tool, so it should not contain anything you determine is sensitive information.  The privacy policy can be found in full here: https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/about-section-privacy-statement 
  * If you get really stuck, here are some sources for openly available text
    * Early English Books Online - https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebogroup/
    * Project Gutenberg - https://www.gutenberg.org/


#### 2. Come to the session prepared to share your screen. 


### During the Session
#### 1. We will do a group exercise with a toolset called Voyant.  
  * Voyant can be found at https://voyant-tools.org/
  * The documentation is exceedingly good! See the full manual - https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/start


#### 2. In breakouts, you will practice using the tool with the texts you brought. You'll explore the tools and determine where the tools excel and where they seem to break down. 
  * Agree upon a list of at least three things you liked most about this tool (can be more).
  * Agree upon a list three things you wish it did that it doesn't do, or three things that it could do better. Assist each other in understanding the full potential of the tool. 
  * What sorts of purposes could you envision using this tool for?  


### After the Session

#### Daily Comment

Please post a reflection on something you learned today or that you would still like to learn. 

Some questions to consider:

* Can you imagine using methods of distant reading in your project? If so, what methods?
* Are there uses outside of your project where text analysis might be useful? 

### Resources

#### Tools: 
 * antconc (https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) - another low barrier tool for text analysis.  Freeware. Runs locally (not cloud based.) 
 * HathiTrust Research Center - https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc
  * Tools overview - https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc_collections_tools
  * The analytics portal - https://analytics.hathitrust.org/
  * Help wiki - https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/x/CAAb - there are also community calls and office hours for help with projects.
  * python (https://www.python.org/) - a popular open-source programming language very useful for text clearning and text analysis.  There are many good tutorials online.  
  * R (https://www.r-project.org/) - a popular open-source programming language (oriented towards statistics) very useful for text clearning and text analysis.  There are many good tutorials online.  
#### Supplemental readings and explorations
 * David Mimno - Cornell Professor of Information Science (https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/) - research focus on computational methods with text.  Blog, code, prototypes and more
 * Ted Underwood - University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign professor of Information Sciences and English - (https://tedunderwood.com/ted-underwood/) blog that discusses his computational work in English.
 * Matthew Jockers professor of English and Data Analytics, now at Apple - (https://www.matthewjockers.net/) - work in sentiment analysis mostly using R.
