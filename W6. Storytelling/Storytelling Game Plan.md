# Storytelling, and telling stories with data

What is a story? Simply put a story is a telling (or retelling) of events, usually for a purpose. As humans, we have been telling each other stories for a long time, much longer than we have recorded history to know.  It is arguable that even as the forms of storytelling differ from culture to culture, stories themselves are fundamental to culture.  Recent neuroscience seems to indicate that our brains are constructed to respond preferentially to storytelling, so it makes sense that exploring the techniques of storytelling can assist us to communicate fully, to gain sensitivity to detect manipulative omissions, and to strike an ethical balance when communicating our own research and conclusions from data.

### Breakouts - what makes a story? 
1. Eliza - please briefly describe the StoryCorps recording process.
2. Join your breakout group to discuss the assigned content.  Refer to the documents prepared for you below in the box folder for day 6 - https://cornell.box.com/s/1ihpi9ejghl9m0qrarg6p37w2wjz4n0v
* Breakout 1 - https://cornell.box.com/s/cztfd1dui36y8xbm1qbrin4407kmnfwm
* Breakout 2 - https://cornell.box.com/s/gyjy3onwsgak1lxawsjrb88inwd9zai6

### Ethics of storytelling, visual storytelling
Eliza will lead a discussion involving visualization of data, representation, and ethics. We will reference the work of Alberto Cairo (http://albertocairo.com/). 

### How are stories told? What story am I being told? What story can I tell? 
Breakouts - On the first day we gathered, we referred to a list of digital projects. (See https://github.com/cornell-colab/SGFDH-2021/blob/main/W1-Introduction/List%20of%20Projects.md).  In your breakout group:
  *  Open up your group document
     *  Group 1 - https://cornell.app.box.com/notes/820624007004
     *  Group 2 - https://cornell.app.box.com/notes/820638494054
  *  Decide on a project from the project list (link above) to review together.  
  *  Discuss the data the project visualizes, and how that data is being visualized. 
  *  Record your reflections in the documents. (This will make sharing with the full group easier.)
