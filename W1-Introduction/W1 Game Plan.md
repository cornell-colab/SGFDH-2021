# Day 1: Introduction to DH

### Before the Session

From the [list of projects](https://github.com/cornell-colab/SGFDH-2021/blob/main/W1-Introduction/List%20of%20Projects.md), choose (a) one or two of the large Team Projects, and (b) one or two of the projects created by students (many of them Summer Fellow Alums).

#### For each of your chosen projects,
 
1. Read and interact with the site until you have a good feeling for the project’s scope, goals, and capabilities.
2. Read any associated “About” information to get a sense of the who the project’s creators are (and how many of them there are), what tools were used in the creation, what its data sources are, and any sources of funding.
 
#### A few questions you might want to consider:
* Who is the intended audience? Scholarly researchers, students, general public, a combination?  
* Is the project primarily meant as a secondary source: the presentation of original research, much like an analog book or article? Or is it meant to be used as primary material for others’ research or creative work? Or is it some combination of these two types?  
* How might the digital aspect of project be used to generate new research questions -- or answers? For the project's creator? For other researchers or students?
* Can you identify the source of the project's underlying data? How was it created or where did it come from?  
* How was the data processed or analyzed? What choices did the project's creator(s) make? Can you identify the tools used to process or analyze the data?
* How has the data been *presented*? What storytelling choices did the creator(s) make? Can you identify the platform or tools used to create the presenting website?
* Are the project’s creator(s) writing (or have they already written) published works derived from or as accompaniments to their digital project?
* Do the creators offer their data or code for reuse by others?  
* In what ways do find the project successful or unsuccessful?
* What are your questions?

(We'll continue to refer to the projects in this list over the next few weeks.)

### After the Session: Reflection Post

After we've met, post a short reflection on the 2021 Fellows Discussion Board. Address any of these questions:  

* Think about the data (or sources) that will underlie your own project. What issues do you foresee you may need to address as you assemble, process, analyze, and present your data?
* What are some factors that are important to the success of a digital project that you want to replicate in your own project?  
* What do you want to understand better?  
* What do you want to know how to do? 

Also (optional):  
* From your experience in the past three semesters of online teaching and learning, what have you learned about online learning? What suggestions do you have for creating a positive learning environment and collaborative cohort this summer online? 

Consider the discussions posted by your fellow fellows, and comment on any that you'd like to.
